# Themes

Inspired by the Dusk/Midnight themes. There are two version of each theme: one with the Source Code Pro (16pt) and Inconsolata (13pt) fonts (for the source code and debug console respectively) and one with the default fonts of most Xcode themes (Menlo 11pt). The custom fonts one has much larger fonts than per default because I like my code to be big.

## Installation

1. Create the folder ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/ if it doesn't already exist.
2. Copy the version of Evenfall.dvtcolortheme or Nightspring.dvtcolortheme that you want to the above folder.
3. Restart Xcode.
